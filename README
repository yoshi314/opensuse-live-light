this is a template relatively small livecd packed with openbox.

It's fairly minimal atm, i plan to try to expand on it.

In order to build it, kiwi appliance builder is required. You can install is on most rpm-based distributions.

Template was adapted from 11.4 minimal openbox appliance from suse-studio.

If you want to integrate any extra files into the image, pack them into config-cdroot.tgz (it can be plain tar archive) and put it under config/
